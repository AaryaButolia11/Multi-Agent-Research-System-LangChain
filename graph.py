                        (rewrite with the NEW evidence + the feedback)

The key idea: when the Critic rejects a draft, control does NOT go straight back
to the Writer. It goes through `gap_search`, which reads the Critic's specific
complaints, turns them into fresh web queries (`gap_chain`), pulls and scrapes
*new* sources, and appends them. Only then does the Writer rewrite. So every
revision can improve substance, not just prose — which is what stops the score
from plateauing.

We also keep the best-scoring draft, so if the loop never clears the bar we still
return the strongest report rather than the last one.

Nodes are async so scraping fans out concurrently.
