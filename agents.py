Agents & chains.

Two models on purpose:
  * WRITER runs on gpt-oss-120b (strong long-form synthesis);
  * CRITIC runs on llama-3.3-70b and returns a *structured* Pydantic object
    (`Critique`) via `with_structured_output`, so the score is a real number the
    graph can branch on — not text we have to regex.

The Writer prompt is revision-aware: on the first pass `feedback` is empty; on a
refinement pass the graph feeds the Critic's improvement points back in.
